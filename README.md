# Weather App

This project is a **Weather App** built using **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**. The app fetches current weather data from the OpenWeatherMap API and displays it on the website. Users can enter the name of any city to get weather information such as temperature, weather conditions, humidity, and wind speed.

1. **User Input**: The app includes a search box where users can enter the name of a city.
2. **Fetch Data from API**: Using JavaScript, the app sends a request to the OpenWeatherMap API with the city name and retrieves the weather data.
3. **Display Weather Data**: The weather data is then displayed on the website, showing the current temperature, weather condition, humidity, and wind speed.
